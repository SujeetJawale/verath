I’m Virat Kohli, and today I want to take you on a journey through my life and career in cricket. Born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, I grew up with a bat in hand and a dream in my heart. Cricket has always been my passion, and I knew from a young age that I wanted to make it my life.

I still remember captaining the Indian team to victory in the Under-19 World Cup in 2008. That moment was surreal; it marked the beginning of my journey with the national team. I made my debut against Sri Lanka later that year, and I felt a mix of excitement and nerves. Playing for India was a dream come true.

Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of representing India in countless matches. There have been highs and lows, but my determination to push boundaries has always driven me. I’ve always believed in chasing targets and never backing down. I take immense pride in being the fastest player to score 10,000 runs in ODIs and leading the team to our historic series win in Australia in 2018-2019.

Leadership has been an incredible journey for me. I strive to inspire my teammates to give their best and play with passion. Seeing my team perform at their peak and achieving our goals together is what I cherish the most.

I’ve always tried to be consistent, and my records—like having the most centuries in ODIs—reflect my hard work and dedication. But it’s not just about personal achievements; it’s about how we can come together as a team and make our fans proud.

Thank you all for being part of this journey with me. Your support means the world, and I promise to keep striving for excellence, both on and off the field.

Cheers,
Virat Kohli
